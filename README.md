Learning how to use Git commands
This is simply a test project to help me memorize git commands
git --version :- gives me the version of git that am running
git status - gives me the status of the current local directory
git init - makes the current folder a git repository folder
git add . -> adds all the new files to the in the directory to the git repository
git commit -m "message explaining what we are doing in this commit" - commits all the new files in the repository that ready to be committed.
git push origin master - pushes everything commited to the remote repository
- sets up a remote repository onto which to push all the files commited
